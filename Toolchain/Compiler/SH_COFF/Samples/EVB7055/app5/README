Program Name: 
Serial

Purpose:
Demonstrate the use of library functions.


Target Board and setting:
7055 Evaluation board. 
Green LED on PA.0 and Red LED on PA.1
Uses SCI0 of the EVB


File List:
readme.txt	- This file. Project description.
start.s		- start up file. Initialises the stack and calls hw_initialise() for hardware 
		  initialisation. This follows call to main() function.
library.c	- Main program file. Initialises SCI0. Allocates memory
		  Calls few library functions. Waits in while loop for receiving 
		  Characters SCI0.
library.lnk	- Linker script for the project.
library.ram.lnk	- Linker script for the project for RAM target.
hwinit.c	- Implementation of function hw_initialise. 
vects.c		- Vector table entry.
ioaddrs.h	- I/O register description and address definition.
		  Various CPU/PORT Register definitions.
makefile	- Project makefile.


Summary:
Uses few library functions.
1. malloc
2. free
3. memset
4. sprintf
5. sine
6. pow
7. sqrt


Special Notes/instructions:
