Program Name: 
Serial


Purpose:
Demonstrate the use Serial port available on EVB.


Target Board and setting:
7055 Evaluation board. 
Green LED on PA.0 and Red LED on PA.1
Uses SCI0 and SCI1 of the EVB


File List:
readme.txt	- This file. Project description.
start.s		- start up file. Initialises the stack and calls hw_initialise() for hardware 
		  initialisation. This follows call to main() function.
serial.c	- Main program file. Initialises SCI0 and SCI1. Waits in while loop for receiving 
		  characters SCI0.
serial.lnk	- Linker script for the project.
serial.ram.lnk	- Linker script for the project for RAM target.

Summary:
On startup SCI0 and SCI1 are initialised to 38.4K, Data bits 8, parity none and stop bit 1.
A string is sent to both ports.
After this the program waits for characters to be received on SCI0 and then echo's back a received character. While echoing the character both LED's are toggled.


Special Notes/instructions:
Program must be flashed into FLASH ROM. Alternatively if you have HDI monitor 
or GDB stub, you can build RAM image and download it.
You may have to change the jumper settings (JP2 and JP3) of UPB board so that UPB is by-passed so that you can use SCI1.
