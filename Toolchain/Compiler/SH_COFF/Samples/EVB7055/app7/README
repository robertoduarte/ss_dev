Summary:
Simple CPP program. Uses global constructor.
Write a string to SCI0 and waits for characters on SCI0. Echo's back the characters.
While echo, toggles the LED state using FLASH class.


Special Notes/instructions:
The program must be flashed into the Flash ROM of the EVB.
The baud rate of the SCI0 is 38.4K, 8 data bits, None parity and 1 stop bit.
