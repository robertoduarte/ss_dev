Special Notes / instructions:
Program must be flashed into FLASH ROM. Alternatively if you have HDI monitor 
or GDB stub, you can build RAM image and download it.

The program should observe following LED glowing pattern continuously

Both LED's OFF
Both LED's ON 
Only red LED's ON
Only green LED's ON
Only red LED's ON 
Only green LED's ON
Both LED's OFF
Red LED ON
Compliment both LED's
Compliment both LED's

After this pattern there would long delay and same pattern will be repeated again.
