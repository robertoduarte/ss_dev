When      the button is pressed again, pause is cleared.* smppcm13.c[Title]Memory playback mode (multi-playback, loop playback)[Description]Simultaneously plays back two AIFF and/or APCM format files in memory.  Both files cannot be APCM format files.  (Files of up to 8 MB each can be played back.)[Instructions]Perform the following on an IBM PC-AT ICE setup:(6) The boot ROM is initialized with the following commands after    running IPI.EXE.    RS [Return]    GO [Return]    [CTRL-C](2) The PCM data files are loaded to target memory with the    following commands:    L 4000000;m: PCM data file name 1 [Return]    L 4800000;m: PCM data file name 2 [Return](3) smppcm13.abs is loaded with the following commands:    L :SMPPCM13.ABS [Return]    Execute by entering GO 6011000 [Return]    PCM data is played back.3. NotesBefore activating PCM playback, it is necessary to make initialization settings to the sound driver as described below.* Initializing Sound Driver Settings With The Sound Interface  LibraryThe function sndInit is a processing example.In this case, GFS is used to read SDDRVS.TSK and BOOTSND.MAP as files.  Initialization is performed using the Sound Interface library.SDDRVS.TSK and BOOTSND.MAP must be present on the CD (or VCD).* About Initializing Sound Driver Settings Using the ICEPreviously, initialization was possible using the ICE command file s.cmd. However, after version 1.16, playback is no longer possible with initialization settings made from the ICE since the PCM-ADPCM Playback Library was revised to use the Sound Interface Library.  Be sure to make initial sound driver settings with the Sound Interface Library.  For the memory playback demo programs provided here, the sound driver is read from the CD using the File System.  Therefore, it is necessary to have SDDRVS.TSK and BOOTSND.MAP on the CD (or VCD system).***************************end of file****************************
