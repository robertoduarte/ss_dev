Description(1) smpstm1.c    Performs loop playback three times on three interleaved files.(a) Function Descriptions  - SMP_Init()    Initializes File System and Stream System.  - SMP_Open    Sets up the transfer area after opening a stream by its    filename.  - SMP_User    Performed in parallel along with stream access.  - SMP_ChkBuf    Monitors the transfer area and resets it when it is full.  - SMP_Exec    Executes stream access.  The STM_ExecServer shows    STM_EXEC_COMPLETED after looping three times.(2) smpstm2.c    Plays back streams in the order as set in PlayOrder[].(a) Function Descriptions  - SMP_Init()    Initializes File System and Stream System.  - SMP_Open    Sets up the transfer area after opening a stream by its file    name.  Keeps the access gate closed so that the stream data    read in the CD buffer is not read.  - SMP_User    Performed in parallel with stream access.  - SMP_Exec    Executes stream access.  By executing STM_SetLoop(grp,     STM_LOOP_DFL, STM_LOOP_ENDLESS), streams can be played back    in the sequence that they are opened.  When a stream access    completes, the transfer gate is opened, and when data access    starts, the next stream is opened.2. Instructions(1) Installing Data    (a) Copy the following files to a PC with Virtual CD        installed.        stm_mkdt.bat        smp_mkdt.exe        smpstm.scr    (b) Execute stm_mkdt.bat.  The following files are created.          File name  |  Size        -------------+--------        dummy.dat    |    2048        smp_stm.fn1  |  204800        smp_stm.fn2  |  409600        smp_stm.fn3  |  819200        smp_stm.1st  |  102400        smp_stm.2nd  |  102400        smp_stm.3rd  |  102400        smp_stm.4th  |  102400        smp_stm.5th  |  102400    (c) Create a disc image by running VCDBUILD using smpstm.scr.        For details on building a disc image, see the Virtual CD        User's Manual.(2) Running the Program    (a) Set the CD switch on the target to VCD.    (b) Start up VCDEMU.    (c) Initialize the target with by executing the boot ROM.    (e) Run the program from 6010000H.***************************end of file****************************
