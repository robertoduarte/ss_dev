[Title]

High-level CPU DMA demo

[Description]

Performs DMA transfers using CPU-based high-level functions. The
details of the transfer are shown below. Access the results of the
transfer from address 0x6040000.

WARNING:

Transfers with WORK RAM as the transfer source do not execute
correctly.

* smpdma10.c

[Title]

Low-level DMA demo.

[Description]

Performs DMA transfers using low-level DMA functions. The details
of the transfer are explained below. DMA channels 0, 1 and 2 are
used. Access the results of the transfer from address 0x6040000.

Source             Destination      Cnt
---------------    ---------------  ---
06050000 (WORK) -> 25c00000 (VDP1)  200
06050200 (WORK) -> 25c00200 (VDP1)  200
06050400 (WORK) -> 25c00400 (VDP1)  200

[Instructions]

(1) Initialize the boot ROM with the following commands
	RS [Return]
	GO [Return]
	[CTRL-C]
(2) Load smpper10.abs to address 6002000H and execute with GO
6002000 [Return].

NOTE:

If the program size is small, code is executed only within the
cache. As a result, ICE commands become less effective. This is
normal and should not be considered as a bug.

[Functions Used]

	DMA_ScuGetStatus()
	DMA_ScuSetPrm()
	DMA_ScuStart()
