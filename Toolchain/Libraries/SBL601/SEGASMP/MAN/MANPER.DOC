Sample Description and Instructions* smpper0.c[Title]Demonstration of peripheral control system and system control fetch system.[Description]If a peripheral connected to a connector is changed during the course of a game, the peripheral's ID is determined and the appropriate peripheral data is written to the respective addresses.Gets peripheral data, time data and system data. The write addresses are shown below.	0x6040000 system data	0x6040020 peripheral data	0x6040030 time dataPeripheral data fetch settings are shown below.	Type: Digital device	Number of fetches: 2[Instructions](1) Initialize the boot ROM with the following commands	RS [Return]	GO [Return]	[CTRL-C](2) Load smpper0.abs to address 6002000H and execute with GO 6002000 [Return].(3) Press any button of any connected peripheral.(4) Peripheral data will be written correctly even if the peripheral connected to the connector is changed.[Functions Used]	PER_Init()	PER_GetPer()	PER_GET_TIM()	PER_GET_SYS()* smpper1.c[Title]Demonstration of system management system.[Description]Demo executes SMPC system management system commands. Enter the number of the command to be executed at *(Uint32*)0x6050000. When a command requires input of its own, enter it from *(Uint8*)0x6050030.Command number -> *(Uint32*)0x6050000Input -> *(UINT32*)0x6050030+-----------------------------------+| Command #    Command Name         |+-----------------------------------+|      0x01    Master SH2 ON        ||      0x02    Slave SH2 ON         ||      0x03    Slave SH2 OFF        ||      0x04    Sound ON             ||      0x05    Sound OFF            ||      0x06    CD ON                ||      0x07    CD OFF               ||      0x08    System reset         ||      0x09    NMI request          ||      0x0a    Enable hot reset     ||      0x0b    Disable hot reset    ||      0x0c    Set SMPC memory      ||      0x0d    Set time             |+-----------------------------------+[Instructions](1) Initialize the boot ROM with the following commands	RS [Return]	GO [Return]	[CTRL-C](2) Load smpper0.abs to address 6002000H and execute with GO 6002000 [Return].[Functions Used]	All***************************end of file***************************
