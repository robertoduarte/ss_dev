******************************************************************mansys.doc -- Sample IP Explanation FileCopyright(c) 1994 SEGAWritten by T.S on 1994-11-11 Ver.1.00Updated by M.K on 1994-11-11 Ver.1.10******************************************************************(1) About [smpsys.c]The sample application initialization program [smpsys.c] is written in C in this version.  The old [smpsys.src] is no longer necessary.Sample initialization routines for VDP memory and other devices are contained in [smpsys.c].  This addresses screen display bugs that occur at the startup of an application (e.g., the Multiplayer control panel or remaining graphics in the frame buffer are displayed momentarily prior to the execution of the application).The execution time for [smpsys.c] is approximately 0.1 second.  It is executed during the license display, and the display is extended by that amount of time.  For more optimized processing, customize the code by adding/deleting processes for the application as required.(2) Customizing [smpsys.c]For example, [smpsys.c] may be used for memory initialization preprocessing that occurs to the startup of the application.  However, if a clock switch does not occur, it is more effective to write data for the application.In addition, when the system clock is switched from 26MHz to 28MHz, VDP1, VDP2, and SCSP register settings as well data contained in memory areas other than work RAM (H) are destroyed.  Since these areas need to be reset after the switch, other processes that can be delayed should be delayed.(3) About [..\segalib\lib\sys_init.obj][sys_init.obj] is an 80H byte object that initializes the system work area.  Place it immediately after the area code in the IP.  The new link batch file [smpsys.lnk] contains this linkage information.(4) Change to the 1st Read Specification AreaSet the 1st read area to work RAM (L or H) with a 4 byte boundary.  The valid address range is 200000H to 2FFFFCH or 6002000H + IP size to 60FFFFCH.(5) Other ChangesThe system ID specifications are the same as the August 22, 1994 version.  However, the sample IP size has increased, so the description of the size has changed from 1000H to 1800 H).When used on the CD (or during emulation), the size description is bigger than the actual IP file size.  No problems will occur if the size range is 1000H to 8000H.  However, make sure there is adequate load area has been allocated.The attached [ip.bin] system ID description is for a CD.  To use this as a cartridge IP, it is necessary to modify [sys_id.src] and rebuild it.When specifying 1st read address for cartridges, the 1st read size description must not be omitted.  When downloading data, the 1st read transfer source file must be stored from the address immediately after the IP according to the IP size description.***************************end of file****************************
