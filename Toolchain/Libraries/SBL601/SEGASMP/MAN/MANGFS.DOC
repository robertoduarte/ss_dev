Sample Description and Instructions* smpgfs01.c[Title]Simple read of files.[Description]Reads a part of one file and returns upon completion.[Instructions](a) Run the boot ROM and initialize the target.(b) Load the executable file on the target.(c) Load the memory file using the following command:   :ll 24020000;m:memfile.bin(d) Set the break point using the following command:    b !gfsd/GFS_Init(e) Execute from address 6010000.(f) When the execution stops at GFS_Init, set the memory file    using the following command:    :m XXXXXXXX 24020000;l    Set the "XXXXXXXX" value by looking up the address of     GFMC_base in the MAP file.(g) When the PC reaches 6010026, the data is put into buf.    To look up the buf address, check the MAP file.[Functions Used]	GFS_Init	GFS_Open	GFS_Fread	GFS_Close	GFS_NameToId[Comments]Run the demo with no CD-ROM installed in the system.Demo opens files by file identifier and by file name.	smpgfs1a.abs    File opening by file identifier	smpgfs1b.abs    File opening by file name* smpgfs02.c[Title]Multiple file access demo.[Description]Reads multiple files in immediate-return format.[Instructions](a) Initialize the target by the boot ROM.(b) Load the execution file on the target.(c) Load the memory file using the following command:    :ll 24020000;m:memfile.bin(d) Set up the break point using the following command:    b !gfsd/GFS_Init(e) Execute from address 6010000.(f) When the execution stops at GFS_Init, set up the memory     file using the following command:   :m XXXXXXXX 24020000;l    Set the "XXXXXXXX" value here by looking up the address of     GFMC_base in the MAP file.(g) When the PC reaches 6010026, the read data is placed into the     following addresses. (Look up the addresses of the following    symbols in the MAP file)      buf1    Data from SIZE10S.DAT      buf2    Data from SIMM1.DAT      buf3    Data from SIMM_DOS.DAT[Functions Used]	GFS_Init	GFS_NwFread	GFS_NwExecServer	GFS_Close	GFS_NameToId	GFS_Open[Comments]Run the demo with no CD-ROM installed on the system.  By stating necessary processes in the function "user", those processes can be executed in parallel along with file access.2. Using the Sample Program to Access Files on CD-ROM or VCD   To execute this sample program to access the files on a CD-ROM   or a Virtual CD setup, do the following:   (a) Copy the following files on a PC with Virtual CD installed.       gfs_mkdt.bat       smp_mkdt.exe       smpgfs.scr   (b) Start gfs_mkdt.bat.  The following will be created:       File name       Size (byte)       --------------------------------       SIZE10S.DAT       20480       SIZE2048.DAT       2048       SIMM1.DAT         10240       SIMM_DOS.DAT      21504   (c) Start Virtual CD with smpgfs.scr.  For details, see the       Virtual CD User's Manual.   (d) Operate according to the instruction of each demo.***************************end of file****************************
