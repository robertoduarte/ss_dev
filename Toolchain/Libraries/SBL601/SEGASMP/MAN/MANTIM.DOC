Sample Description and Instructions* smptim0.c[Title]Demonstration of SCU's timer function.[Description]A sample using the SCU's timer 0 and timer 1. Checks whether the timer is being set correctly by setting timer interrupt routines.[Instructions](1) Initialize the boot ROM with the following commands	RS [Return]	GO [Return]	[CTRL-C](2) Load smpper0.abs to address 6002000H and execute with GO 6002000 [Return].(3) Press the button of any connected peripheral.(4) Information will be written correctly even if the peripheral connected to the connector is changed during the process.[Functions Used]	TIM_T0_SET_CMP()	TIM_T1_SET_DATA()	TIM_T1_SET_MODE()	TIM_T1_ENABLE()	TIM_T0_ENABLE()* smptim1.c[Title]Demonstration of the CPU's Free Running Timer (FRT) feature.[Description]Sample uses the CPU's FRT. Gets the counter value and waits for time.[Instructions](1) Initialize the boot ROM with the following commands	RS [Return]	GO [Return]	[CTRL-C](2) Load smpper0.abs to address 6002000H and execute with GO 6002000 [Return].(3) Press the button of any connected peripheral.(4) Information will be written correctly even if the peripheral connected to the connector is changed during the process.[Functions Used]	TIM_FRT_INIT()	TIM_FRT_DELAY_16()	TIM_FRT_GET_16()	TIM_FRT_CNT_TO_MCR()	TIM_FRT_MCR_TO_CNT()***************************end of file***************************
