README.DOC for Slave CPU Sample ProgramThe following are sample programs that demonstrate the use of the slave CPU.Although many of the code examples presented here are excerpted from the SBL, different names are intentionally assigned to the slave CPU matrix calculation code modules for identifications purposes (slv_mtx3.src).The master and slave CPUs execute in the same manner for the re-entrant modules and functions.Makefile:      Makefile for GNU make-------------  ----------------------------------------------slvsamp.abs:   Execution fileslvsamp.c:     Main moduleslvsamp.map:   Map file for this sample programslvsamp.sub:   Link file for this sample programslave.lib:     Initialization library generated by slaveSH.cslaveSH.c:     Slave CPU initialization library main moduleslaveSH.sub:   Slave CPU initialization library link fileslv_mtx3.h:    Matrix calculation module header for slave CPUslv_mtx3.src:  Matrix calculation module for slave CPUspr_mtx3.h:    Matrix calculation module header for master CPUspr_mtx3.src:  Matrix calculation module for master CPUsmpstrt1.src:  Execution environment init module for SHC (1)smpstrt2.c:    Execution environment init module for SHC (2)sega_spr.h:    Basic Sprite Library headersega_xpt.h:    Common header filespr_fmat.src:  32 bit fixed-point calculation modulespr_sinc.src:  SIN, COS calculation module (1)spr_xpt.c:     SIN, COS calculation module (2)dual.bat:      DOS .BAT file
