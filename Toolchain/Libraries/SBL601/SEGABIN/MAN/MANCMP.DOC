Data Compression Tool Manual


1. Preface

   This disk contains the following three tools for run length
   compression.
	IBM-PC version : SEBABIN/BIN/CMPRUN.EXE
	HP(WS) version : SEBABIN/BINHP/cmprun
	SUN version    : SEGABIN/BINSUN/cmprun
   These three files are different only in their execution
   environment.  Their functions and the usage are the same.  The
   following explains how to use the files.

2.  Activation

    To activate, type as follows at the command prompt.

	> CPMRUN [-U(1|2|4)] [-S(0|1)] filename [outfile] [RET]

3.  Activation option

-U : Processing unit.  The number of bytes of a character
     (symbol).
	When optimizing, this option is ignored.

	-U1 : Processes 1 byte as a unit (default).

	-U2 : Processes 2 bytes as a unit.

	-U4 : Processes 4 bytes as a unit


-S : Optimization

	-S1 : No optimization (default).

	-S2 : With optimization.  It tries to compress in each
           processing unit and outputs the best compression ratio.


4. Input

	filename : Name of the file to be processed


5.  Output

	outfile  : Compression file name
If this option is omitted, default extension .cmp will be added to
the output file name.  The original file name with its extension
changed to .cmp is used as the output file name.

6.  Note

Since this program is a little different from the general run
length compression program, the special expansion library
SEGA_CMP.LIB is necessary when expanding files.
