****************************************************************About ADDGEN ToolsAugust 31, 1995, H.T.****************************************************************1. Overview   ADGEN outputs a subcommand file for adding/deleting/replacing      a file based on a comparison of the VCDBUILD script file    (hereafter referred to as a script file) and the CD-ROM were.2. Instructions   (1) Set the CD-ROM to CD-E100.   (2) Activate ADDGEN.3. Startup   C:\>addgen script file name [subcommand file name] [option]   (1) Script File Name       The name of a script file describing the contents of an            updated CD-ROM.  When the file name extension is omitted,        this is regarded as omitting ".scr."   (2) Subcommand File Name       The name of an output ADDCDW subcommand file.  When           omitted, a subcommand file with ".cdw" appended to the        script file name is output.   (3) Options       One of the following can be selected for the file        comparison method.       (a) Comparing Date and Time (default)[Option]-t[Contents]The dates and times of a file on DOS and a file on a CD-ROM are compared, and the files are replaced if the file on DOS is more recent.        (b) Compare Contents[Option]-c[Contents]The contents of a file on DOS and a file on a CD-ROM are compared, and when there has been a change, the files are replaced.  However, dates and times are compared for interleaved files and MPEG stream CDDA files.4. Operation   The script file and final session on a CD-ROM are compared,    and a subcommand file is output.  In the following cases,    each subcommand is output.   (1) Performing full write-once       (a) When the CD-ROM set in CD-E100 is new.       (b) When adding/deleting the directory.       (c) When an interleaved file is added/deleted.   (2) Adding a file       (a) When a file not on a CD-ROM is on a script file.   (3) Deleting a file       (a) When a file on a CD-ROM is not on a script file.   (4) Replacing files       (a) When files are compared with a method specified by an           option, and a file is changed.5. Error levels   The following error labels are returned to DOS according to     the execution results.   (1) Error level: 0       When execution completed normally.  A subcommand file is         output, and ADDCDW can be executed.   (2) Error level: 1       When full write-once is necessary, but creation of the        disc image file and TOC file has not been completed.  A        subcommand file is output, and after VCDBUILD and        VCDMKTOC are executed, ADDCDW can be executed.   (3) Error level: 2       When processing cannot be continued.  See error messages        for details.6. Other   (1) Restrictions       The number of files which can be entered into a script        file must be the same or less than the number displayed        in MAX FILE at activation.
