For those using old ROM boards, a new ROM can be sent to you by your local technical support center.  Be sure to exchange the ROM in accordance with the attached installation instructions.  With ROMs before version 3.2, data transfer can be unstable and may lead to system crashes for disc images containing multi-track indexes of 50 or more.* * * * Test Build And Execution* Creating CD Image Files  A CD image files is created on a PC set up with VCD.  (1) Execute pre-processing programs      C:\>VCDPRE JVC[RET]  (2) Create CD image files      C:\>VCDBUILD JVC[RET]      A file called JVC.DSK is created.* Starting Up the Virtual CD emulator  Activates the Virtual CD Emulator on a Virtual CD setup.  C:\>CHEV US /F[RET]  C:\>VCDEMU JVC[RET]  The Virtual CD Emulator should be activated.* Loading the Program  Start up the PC used for code development and the target.  Execute the following:  :[Initialization by BOOT ROM (OK to display logo on screen)]  :<JVC.INI[RET]  :G 6002000[RET]For detailed information on the Virtual CD system, see the "Virtual CD System User's Manual" and the "Virtual CD System Supplementary Manual."* * * * Restrictions* VCDEMU.EXEThe total track count x index that can be emulated is restricted to approximately 2000 by default, or 5000 via the option setting.  Accordingly, approximately 50 indices per track can be set up for a maximum of 99 tracks for emulation.* VCDBUILD.EXE Ver.3.10In the past, keywords used in script notation were case-sensitive (uppercase vs. lowercase).  Starting from this version, the application is no longer case-sensitive.  Example:    Previously had to be Disc.      |      V    DISC, disc, diSc are now all acceptable.Parameters remain case-sensitive as before.  CDROM must be denoted as CDROM.* * * * Bug Fixes* VCDEMU.EXE Ver.1.80->Ver.1.91Partially supports update mode.* VCDEMU.EXE Ver.1.91->Ver.1.83Until this version, only updated DOS input files were played back in the direct DOS mode.  That is, they were regarded as DOS file units.  This was expanded to include ISO file units.  When disk image files are not changed and certain DOS files are updated (update information file is output), the direct DOS file mode is in effect for the updated portion, and playback is in direct DOS file mode until the playback of the ISO file ends.When returning from direct DOS access mode to real time mode, a disk image position that continues from the address of the sector data sent by the direct DOS mode is used. (Same as previous specifications.)The updated DOS file becomes larger than the original DOS file.  As a result, when the size of the original ISO file is exceeded, the DOS files in that ISO file are transferred completely.  The beginning of the next ISO file is erased by the amount overwritten by the larger file (that data will not be transferred).* VCDEMU.EXE Ver.1.83->Ver.1.84Fast forward and rewind now work properly in the real time emulation mode.  (With versions after 1.81, there were cases when these functions did not function properly at the beginning.)The problem of noise entering the silence between tracks during DA playback in direct DOS mode has been fixed.* VCDBUILD.EXE Ver.3.10The directory record is now always placed at the beginning of a sector whenever a large number of files causes the directory file to extend over multiple sectors.Processing now aborts when files with the same name exist.Bugs that occurred during directory configuration were fixed.Processing was optimized by 2 to 6 times.The DOS extender used by the application was changed to DOS/4G.  Operation has been confirmed with up to approximately 10,000 files for machines configured with 8MB of RAM.Errors in the directory record position were corrected.A bug that caused the TOC position of CDDA audio data to be off was corrected.A directory path table bug was fixed.A bug that corrupted file locations when a directory definition was made after a track specification was fixed.* VCDBUILD.EXE Ver.3.10->Ver.3.20The size of the channel-interleaved file was calculated along with the GAP size of the last-placed channel.  This was fixed so that the file size is now calculated correctly.The channel numbers specified for channel interleave was restricted to 250 or less, but now numbers 251 to 255 can also be used.Attribute bit settings in the system area of the directory record for MPEG files can now be set correctly.AUDIO and MPEG_VIDEO were added to source type.A positive integer up to 65536 can be specified now for the sector rate.This version of the software has been upgraded so that 0 data of 16 words is appended immediately after the MPEG video stream sequence_end_code.In the same manner, the software has been upgraded so that when the MpegFlush command is specified, 0 data of 16KB is appended immediately before the MPEG video stream's sequence_end_code.VCDBUILD is now capable of output to a file specified by the MPEG multiplex data.  By running VCDBUILD twice, it is now possible to channel interleave MPEG as well as other data.The software has been upgraded so that a position on disc can be specified by FAD instead of by time (minutes:seconds:frames).The included script error line number display was fixed.* VCDBUILD.EXE Ver.3.20->Ver.3.32VCDPRE is no longer distributed.  In place of VCDPRE, a "-p" or "/p" option has been added to VCDBUILD which prevents a disc image from being created.  By specifying this option, VCDBUILD performs the same processing as VCDPRE.  Therefore, see the explanation for VCDPRE when using this option in VCDBUILD.Until this version, temporary files required for processing were created in the current directory.  Temporary files are now created in the path of the disk image files (*.dsk files) specified by scripts.  Temporary files are created in the following cases:  a) When creating a channel interleaved file.  b) During file interleaving when option /f(-f) is specified.  c) When creating MPEG files.A disc image file is the file specified by the disc line parameters.When /p is specified, temporary files are created in the path directory of a file path (*.pvd files) specified in the Volume line.  The *.qsb file that corresponds to the CDDA track created at this time is generated in the directory of the *.pvd file.RTI files used the first parameter of the VCDBUILD execution command line as the body name, and the file extension .RTI was appended.  However, when this body name is not path specified, the RTI file is generated either in the *.dsk or *.pvd file's directory path as in the two items above.In prior versions, temporary files generated during the creation of MPEG files were not deleted after the completion of processing.  The software has been modified so that the file is deleted.When a DOS file that is not defined as an ISO file is specified to a CDDA track, a track will be generated without any data if the specified DOS file does not exist.  In this case, many dummy sectors were created (more than 4 seconds worth of data).  A symptoms of this problem is usually the display of an error message such as "File Not Exist" and an apparent crash of the system.  This problem has been addressed in this version.  * Other:    Due to CD standards that require a minimum of 4-second area    per track, dummy data is now automatically generated until the    file size reaches 4 seconds for tracks that have data content    that is less than 4 seconds.  This function has been enabled    as of version 3.10.* VCDBUILD.EXE Ver.3.32->Ver.3.34In VCDBUILD, the creation date of ISO files is now the date of the latst updated source DOS file.  When an ISO file is configured from multiple source DOS files, the date of the newest file is used.* VCDUTL.EXE Ver.1.00->Ver.1.20When partial update processing is performed to update a disc image, an error will occur if a specification is made that will cause the size of the original ISO file to be exceeded.  This feature is also used if a single ISO file is configured from multiple input data source files and one of the source files becomes larger.The (MinLength) ISO file size used at the time that all disk images are created (by VCDBUILD) is always valid, even if file sizes are made smaller by the updates.* VCDMKTOC.EXE Ver.1.24->Ver.1.25Index values are now output in BCD format.* ADDGEN.EXE Ver.0.70->Ver.1.00Fixed a bug that caused the work area to run out of space when the specified file name was 12 characters long.Processing was modified for the handling of new disks.Message output processing was added at completion.* VCDBUILD.EXE Ver.3.34->Ver.3.37.1.1A bug related to the path table was fixed.* VCDEMU.EXE Ver.1.84->Ver.2.01The processing speed during DOS direct mode was improved.***************************end of file****************************
