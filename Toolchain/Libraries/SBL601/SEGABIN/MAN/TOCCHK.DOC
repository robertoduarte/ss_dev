******************************************************************TOCCHK VER 1.03August 31, 1995******************************************************************1. OverviewTOCCHK checks a TOC file (VCDMKTOC output files "~.TOC") to see whether if it contains valid TOC information and outputs diagnostic messages to an output file.* Check ItemsCheck the following items on your disc image.  (1) Track size check          (should be at least 4 seconds)  (2) Pre-gap size check        (should be at least 2 seconds)  (3) Post-gap size check       (should be at least 1 second)*  (4) Initial audio track pause (should be at least 2 seconds)* NoteThe post-gap mentioned above is specified in the CD-ROM XA standardsAccording to the Yellow Book CD-ROM standards, at least 2 seconds of post-gap must be allocated at the end of data tracks which precedes the audio tracks.  However, this post-gap is not checked because the information is not reflected on a TOC file.Make sure that the following is entered on the VCD script and at the end of the data tracks.Data track prior to CDDA      |         :      |       PostGap 150  ; <-- Is the post-gap at least 2 secs?      V   EndTrack     ---  Track CDDA      |       Pause 150      |       FileSource ~.DAT      |       EndFileSource      V            :  CDDAtrack2. Instructions   TOCCHK  TOCfilename      (extension ".TOC" may be omitted)[Example]To check the TOC file "SAMPLE.TOC" created with VCDMKTOC.EXE and to output the check results to the check file "SAMPLE.TCK," type as follows:  C:\>TOCCHK SAMPLE.TOC >SAMPLE.TCK(This assumes that this is done in the root directory of drive C.)3.

The beginning of pre-gap is                 determined as the point when the FORM byte does                 not change when TNO changes to TNP+1 and X                 changes to 0.  The end of post-gap is determined                 as the point when the FORM byte changes.(3) POST-GAP smaller than 1 sec    Explanation: The post-gap is less than 1 second.                 (CD-ROM XA standards)(4) PRE-GAP missing    Explanation: The FORM byte changed even though the pre-gap                 does not exist.(5) PRE-GAP smaller than 2 sec    Explanation: The pre-gap is less than 2 seconds.                 (CD-ROM XA standards)(6) PAUSE Missing    Explanation: The audio track does not contain PAUSE.(7) PAUSE smaller than 2 sec    Explanation: The pre-gap is less than 2 seconds.                 (CD-ROM XA standards)(8) LeadIn Control(??H) is not DATA    Explanation: The Control in LeadIn area is not in the DATA                 format.
