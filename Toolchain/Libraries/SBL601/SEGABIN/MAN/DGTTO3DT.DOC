  Support RGB format.

1. Overview

   Converts texture and color data in DGT and RGB files to
   software library 3DT format data.

2. Function

  (1) Selection of the necessary texture files is done
      automatically based on the SEGA3D file.
  (2) After defining an RGB value of 0x0 to the empty palettes for
      the palette number undefined pixels (0x0), allocate this
      palette number.
      If there is no empty palette, an error message is output,
      and a number 0 palette is temporarily allocated.
  (3) When the color mode is 0, 2, 3, or 4, a method by which the
      color data table is output in polygon units or a method in
      which all tables are integrated can be selected.

      When outputting in polygon units, the color table name
      should be followed by "_serial No."  For color mode 1,
      output is only possible using polygon units.


3. Notes

  (1) This program outputs only texture and color data.
      Therefore, model information must be output by a separate
      s3dto3dt.
  (2) SEGA3D files and all necessary DGT files must be in the same
      directory.
  (3) When integrating the color data tables into a single table,
      the palette number in the dgt file is used as is, so be
      careful not to allocate different colors between polygons.


4. Restriction Items

  (1) Special characters cannot be used in texture file names
      (except for _).
  (2) The length of each parameter name is:
      - Up to 16 characters
  (3) The maximum value of each data is as follows.
      - Pixel count per file: 50,000


5. Input/Output

  (1) Input data is DGT format or RGB format data and SEGA3D
      format data.
      The SEGA3D format data default extender is .3d.
  (2) Output data is 3DT format data.


6. Execution Format

dgtto3dt  (input/output file directory path name) (SEGA3D file
          name)
          - Note that the input/output file name excludes
            extenders.


7. Specifying Option Parameters

   (1) Modifications can be made by reading the file in which the
       option parameters are noted.
   (2) This file is shared with 3dto3dt.
   (3) Option file names are the input/output file name plus an
       extender (.ctl), and are placed in the same directory as
       the input/output data.
   (4) When there is no option file, the default is used.
   (5) Anything after a semicolon (;) is regarded as a comment.
   (6) Following are parameters which can be specified:

Keyword               Parameter                  default

dgt_txc               Output file name           |  no
col_tbl               Color table name           |  colorData
input                 Extender name              |  3d
col_mode              Color mode                 |  1
(Add)spd_mode         Transparent disabled mode  |  no
     palette_mode     Color table format         |  sep

dgt_txc specifies the output file name.  The file name is input
inside quotation marks (").  This is a required parameter, so if
not specified, an error message appears and processing ends.

col_tbl specifies the color table name.

input specifies the extender name of the input file.  It must be
three or less alphanumeric characters.

col_mode specifies the color mode.
  For mode 0 (16 color bank mode)              0
  For mode 1 (16 color look up table mode)     1
  For mode 2 (64 color bank mode)              2
  For mode 3 (128 color bank mode)             3
  For mode 4 (256 color bank mode)             4
  For mode 5 (32 color RGB mode)               5
  is specified.

spd_mode disables the transparent pixels of characters.
  To disable transparent pixels                on
  When not disabling transparent pixels        off

palette_mode specifies the color table output format.
  When outputting the color table in polygon units            sep
  When outputting the color tables integrated into one table  comp

Entering Example

; option parameter define file ( .ctl )

dgt_txc         "sample.txc"
col_tbl         colorTable
input           s3d
col_mode        4
palette_mode    comp

2. Execution Procedure (for 16 color palette mode data)

For example, let us assume that SEGA3D data is sample.3d, and
graphic data is tex_1.dgt and tex_2.dgt.


  (1) Create a control data file.  Match the name with SEGA3D
      data. In this case, the name will be sample.ctl.  The
      contents are as follows.
-----------------------------------------------------
; option parameter define file ( .ctl )
col_mode   1
shading    *,no
dgt_txc    "sample.txc"
-----------------------------------------------------
(Note) col_mode is 1 when using 16 color palette mode data.
       shading should always be left as shown here.
       There is no problem with using any freely chosen name for
       dgt_txc, but to ensure that there is not overlap of names
       later, it is better to match with ".3d"  names.  Extenders
       will hereafter be ".txc"  for the sake of convenience.


  (2) sample.3d, tex_1.dgt, tex_2.dgt, and sample.ctl should be
      placed in the same directory.


  (3) Executes s3dto3dt and dgtto3dt.  It does not matter which is
      processed first.  When starting from the directory in which
      data is stored, the format is as follows.
-----------------------------------------------------
s3dto3dt . sample
dgtto3dt . sample
-----------------------------------------------------


  (4) The following two files can be created in the same directory
      as the input data.  .dat is the output data of s3dto3dt, and
      .txc is the output data of dgtto3dt.
      These are groups of two, so they must be moved
      simultaneously.
-----------------------------------------------------
sample.dat
sample.txc
-----------------------------------------------------
(Note) There is a specification to include sample.txc in
       sample.dat.  With an application, both data can be fetched
       simply by including sample.dat.


  (5) Specify the inclusion of sample.dat in the application, and
      then compile.



3. Supplementary Items

- Special characters cannot be used (except for _) for the
  variable name for .dat and .txc because of passing through the c
  compiler, so check in advance and remove special characters.

- In .ctl, specifying dgt_txc, while specifying the texture file
  name that the 3DT file will reference, also means inhibition of
  output of texture related information on the s3dto3dt side.

  When specifying no shading using "shading *,no"  in .ctl, when
  shading using palette format data with the software library, it
  is necessary to prepare a shading index table for each color,
  because this converter cannot generate this data.

- There are parameters other than those shown in the examples in
  .ctl.  For detailed information on these parameters, see the
  .doc file for each program.

- When the color mode is 1, specifications relating to the color
  table on the application side are not necessary.

  However, make sure that the maximum number of look up tables
  specified by SPR_2DefineWork is not less than the number of
  textures.

- When the color mode is 0, 2, 3, or 4, combine the color table
  name in the application with the color table name in the .txc
  file (default is colorData).

  When doing this, make sure that the table size secured by the
  application is not smaller than the size of the table used.

  The processing procedure when the color mode is 0, 2, 3, or 4 is
  no different from the aforementioned procedure when the color
  mode is 1, but make sure the contents of the .ctl file are as
  follows.
-----------------------------------------------------
; option parameter define file ( .ctl )

col_mode       4
palette_mode   comp
shading        *,no
dgt_txc        "sample.txc"
-----------------------------------------------------
(Note) Select the col_mode from 0, 2, 3, or 4 as necessary.
       Select comp or sep for the palette_mode according to the
       creation method of the application.
