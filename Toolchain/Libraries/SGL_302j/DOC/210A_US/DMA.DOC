******************************************************************************DMA Control and Cache Control Functions************************************************************************************************************************************************************void slDMACopy((void *)src, (void *)dst, (Uint32)cnt)******************************************************************************Function: Performs a block transfer using the CPU's DMA functions. cnt sets the number of bytes that are transferred. Since this function terminates immediately after executing the DMA, use the next slDMAWait() to check the completion of the transfer.******************************************************************************void slDMAXCopy((void *)src, (void *)dst, (Uint32)cnt (Uint16)mode)******************************************************************************Function: Performs a block transfer using the CPU's DMA functions.Although the parameters are the same as for slDMACopy mentioned above, the modes are specified as follows.mode:  Uses the format: SourceMode_DestinationMode_Size  SourceMode :    Sinc : Transfers while incrementing the transfer source address.    Sdec : Transfers while decrementing the transfer source address.    Sfix : Transfers with a fixed transfer source address.  DestinationMode :    Dinc : Transfers while incrementing the transfer destination address.    Ddec : Transfers while decrementing the transfer destination address.    Dfix : Transfers with a fixed transfer destination address.  Size :    Byte : Transfers 1 byte at a time.    Word : Transfers 2 bytes at a time.    Long : Transfers 4 bytes at a time.Addresses are updated each time the transfer of a transfer unit ends. When a address decrement is specified, note that the transfer is made to the specified destination address first. The address then decrements, and the next transfer is executed.******************************************************************************void slDMAWait()******************************************************************************Function: Waits for the end of the DMA started with slDMACopy() and slDMAXCopy().The same channel is always used by slDMACopy() and slDMAXCopy(). If the function is in the process of execution, a new transfer starts after the transfer is completed. It is possible to execute transfers continuously with this process.Example:slDMACopy(src0,dst0,cnt0) ; /* 1st transfer request */slDMACopy(src1,dst1,cnt1) ; /* 2nd transfer request (starts after 1st ends) */slDMACopy(src2,dst2,cnt2) ; /* 3rd transfer request (same process as above) */slDMAWait() 		  ; /* Awaits completion of the 3rd transfer */******************************************************************************BooleanSwitch slDMAStatus()******************************************************************************Function: Checks if slDMACopy() and slDMAXCopy() are executing and returns status.Returns ON if the transfer is in progress, OFF if completed.******************************************************************************void slCashPurge()******************************************************************************Function: Clears internal CPU cache. Used when the cache area is modified by a function such as a DMA transfer.If the transfer destination for slDMACopy() or slDMAXCopy() is a cache region, the cache must be cleared.
