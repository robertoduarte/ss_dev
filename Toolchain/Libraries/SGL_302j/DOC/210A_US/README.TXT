** README.TXT **

This disc is the Sega Saturn Development Tool SGL (Sega 3D Game Library) disc.  The 
directory configuration is divided into a PC directory and an SGI directory for each 
development machine.

Although the PC directory is fully expanded and created, the SGI directory is stored on 
this disc in a compressed state.  Read the "README" file in the SGI directory before 
expanding the SGI directory.
